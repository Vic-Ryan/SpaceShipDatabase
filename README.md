# SpaceShipDatabase
Final project for EFA Blue Badge

## Usage
This program is designed to be able to create a database of different space-fairing vessels from various sources, both real and fictional.

It's designed to be able to both create, edit, grab, and delete items from its database, using SQL code instructions such as Get, Pull, Put, and Delete.

By using such commands through programs such as Postman, you will be able to access the database as well, including the seeded in content pre-prepared for use.

The prograsm is also equipped with Swagger capabilities for ease of use as well.
## Contributors
At this current state, the project is not open for outside contributions, and is only for use in ElevenFifty Academy and the students/teachers affiliated with the project.


## Downloading
The code and database should all be set to run after copying it in. Once you have, you can either use programs like postmate, or even typing in /swagger at the end to access more ease of use.

It should be noted that individual accounts must be registered beforehand to access, acquiring a token to be able to edit and delete posts. However, posting and retrieving data need no such information.
